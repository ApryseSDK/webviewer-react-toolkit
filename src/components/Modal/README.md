Modals provide the ability to add confirmation or display important information
to the user. These can be easily dismissed by adding an `onClose`, as well as
`closeOnBackgroundClick` and `closeOnEscape` at your discretion.

Alternatively, they can enforce that the user completes the required action by
removing the `onClose` and adding your own confirmation buttons to the
`buttonGroup`.

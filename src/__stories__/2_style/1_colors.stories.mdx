# Colors

In order to get you started, we ship the toolkit with some basic theme colors
that are used on our visual components. These are configurable, but provide a
good starting point to speed up development.

> The WebViewer React Toolkit css stylesheet contains
> [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).
> It also includes a file of Sass variables that might be helpful for development
> if you use Sass.

## Using

To use these in your own project, you can include the colors in your code in
order to match the theme of the toolkit:

```scss
div {
  /* If you are using CSS: */
  font-color: var(--color-font-primary);
  /* If you are using Sass: */
  font-color: $color-font-primary;
}
```
## Overriding

These can be overridden by setting the variables yourself in the root. Since the
Sass variables also use the CSS variables, it will allow you to control the
colors used across the toolkit. Here's an example of overriding the theme colors:

```css
/* your_custom_theme.css */
:root {
  --color-font-primary: red;
  --color-font-secondary: orange;
}
```

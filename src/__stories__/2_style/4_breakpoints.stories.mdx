# Breakpoints

Unfortunately,
[CSS variables do not work in media queries](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40723269),
and so breakpoints are not customizable. However, we provide our breakpoints for
you to use, either as Sass mixins, or just hard-coded pixel values.

## Using

To use these in your own project, you can include the mixins in your code:

```scss
div {
  @include for-tablet-up {
    background-color: blue;
  };
}
```

Or copy the code into your CSS files:

```css
div {
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    @content;
  }
}
```

If you are using Sass, make sure you import the Sass breakpoints file:

```scss
@import "~@pdftron/webviewer-react-toolkit/dist/scss/_breakpoints.scss";
```

## Breakpoint Visualizer

You can change the size of your browser window to see the breakpoints in effect.

<Breakpoints />

## Mixins

The following mixins show the value you can include in your code, as well as the
raw values in case you wish to copy them to CSS code. You can click any of these
to copy the value to your clipboard.

<Mixins index={0} />

```scss
// Try not to use this, as it breaks "mobile first" principles.
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  /* Content */
}
```

<Mixins index={1} />

```scss
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Content */
}
```

<Mixins index={2} />

```scss
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Content */

# Variables

To allow consistency over our variables, we centralize the style by using
a number of variables to control everything from font size to breakpoints. These
are all configurable, and doing so will change the appearance of the toolkit.

> The WebViewer React Toolkit css stylesheet contains
> [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).
> It also includes a file of Sass variables that might be helpful for development
> if you use Sass.

## Using

To use these in your own project, you can include the variables in your code to
match the visual structure outlined in the toolkit:

```scss
div {
  /* If you are using CSS: */
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  /* If you are using Sass: */
  border-radius: $border-radius;
}
```

## Overriding

Since each value is a variable, and all Sass variables just point to the CSS
variables, you can easily the appearance of the toolkit. Here's an example of
overriding the border radius:

```css
/* your_custom_theme.css */
:root {
  --border-radius-small: 1px;
  --border-radius: 6px;
  --border-radius-large: 12px;
}
```

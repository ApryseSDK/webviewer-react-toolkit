# Getting Started

In order to get started using the toolkit, there are some quick and easy
installation steps you will need to go through.

## Installation

You can install the toolkit from npm using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Yarn
yarn add @pdftron/webviewer-react-toolkit

# npm
npm install @pdftron/webviewer-react-toolkit
```

## Style

In order for your components to be styled, you will need to import the toolkit's
CSS file. Also included are
[CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
to include in your project if you wish. If you use
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), you can also include the provided Sass
variables and mixins by including the files as shown below. For more information
on the Sass and CSS variables provided, check out
the <LinkTo title="Style/Colors">Style section</LinkTo>.

### CSS

```css
/* Most loaders will allow this: */
@import "@pdftron/webviewer-react-toolkit";

/* If that doesn't work: */
@import "~@pdftron/webviewer-react-toolkit/lib/style.css";
```

### Sass

> Note that since the mixins use the variables, you will need to import both if
> you are using mixins.

```scss
@import "~@pdftron/webviewer-react-toolkit/lib/_variables.scss";
@import "~@pdftron/webviewer-react-toolkit/lib/_mixins.scss";
```

## Peer Dependencies

Since the toolkit is a React component library, `react` and `react-dom` should
be installed. While any version above `v16.8.0` is supported (the release of
Hooks), it is encouraged that you use the most up-to-date version you can.

## Fonts (optional)

We have designed these components to look good with the
[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) font. It should work with any
font, but if you want to include Lato as the base font, you can do it like this:

```html
<style>
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,400i,700,700i&display=swap');
</style>
```

The toolkit only uses font-weights `400` and `700`, but you can install more if you
wish to use them in your code.

## Use It

You should now be able to import and use the toolkit in your project!

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@pdftron/webviewer-react-toolkit';

export function Component({ message, onClick }) {
  return (
    <>
      <div>{message}</div>
      <Button buttonStyle="borderless" onClick={onClick}>
        Click here!
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```
